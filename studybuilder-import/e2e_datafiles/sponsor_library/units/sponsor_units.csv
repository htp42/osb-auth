UNIT,(pmol/L)/(U/kg),(pmol/L)/(U/kg),(pmol/L)/(U/kg),Picomole per Liter per U per kg,,,,A unit of concentration in pmol per liter divided by dose in U per kg
UNIT,/regimen period,/regimen period,/regimen period,Per Regimen Period,,,,A unit of measure equal to the instances of an entity per regimen period
UNIT,0/00,0/00,0/00,Pro Mille,,,,Equal to pro mille or per thousand
UNIT,Count,Count,Count,Count,,,,A unit of measure referring to the entity counted
UNIT,dB/m,dB/m,dB/m,Decibel per Meter,,,,A unit of decibel per meter
UNIT,DOSE STEP,DOSE STEP,DOSE STEP,Dose Step,,,,"A one step increase in dose based on steps, clicks or increments of a combination product with two different units in a fixed ratio."
UNIT,Fraction of 1,Fraction of 1,Fraction of 1,Fraction of 1,,,,A unit for expressing a percentage as a decimal whereby the total value is measured as a fraction of the numeric 1.
UNIT,g/week,g/week,g/week,Gram per Week,,,,"A unit of mass flow rate equal to one gram per week or a dose
administration rate unit equal to the rate at which a gram of a
product is delivered or administered over the time period of one
week."
UNIT,IU/mL/IU/kg,IU/mL/IU/kg,IU/mL/IU/kg,International Unit per Milliliter per International Unit per kilogram,,,,"A unit of measure used to calculate the IR (incremental recovery) used in haemophilia. It is a PK variable and expresses how much factor activity (that be VIII or IX) increases per infused IU. For recombinant FVIII IR is usually 2%, meaning that FVIII activity in the patient will increase with 2% for every 1 IU infused per kg - meaning a HA patient receiving 50 IU/kg can expect FVIII activity of 100%

The unit for IR in medical papers is usually (IU/ml)/(IU/kg)
IU/ml - referring to the measured increase in activity
IU/kg - referring to the dose      "
UNIT,kJ,kJ,kJ,Kilojoule,,,,"A SI unit of energy equal to 10E3 joules. (NCI)

Joule is a unit of electrical, mechanical, and thermal energy (as well as work and quantity of heat), equal to the work done when the point of application of a force of one Newton is displaced through a distance of one meter in the direction of the force or the work done when a current of one Ampere passes through a resistance of one ohm for one second. 

One joule is equal to 0.23889 gram-calorie (mean).(NCI)

A derived unit defined as the work done or energy required to exert a force of one newton for a distance of one meter. 1 KJ = 2.390 X 10-4 Kilocalorie. (CRCH)"
